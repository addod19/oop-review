# curriculum-cr-training-oop
This Application is based on the Ruby OOP: school library projects 1 and 2.

### Add Basic UI

In this step of the process, I implemented the following:
- [ ] Create a main.rb file with several methods
- [ ] List all books method
- [ ] List all people method
- [ ] Create a person (teacher or student, not a plain Person) method
- [ ] Create a book method
- [ ] Create a rental method
- [ ] List all rentals for a given person id method
- [ ] Present the user with a list of options to perform.
- [ ] Lets users choose an option.
- [ ] If needed, ask for parameters for the option.
- [ ] Have a way to quit the app.
